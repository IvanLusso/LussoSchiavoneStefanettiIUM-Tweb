### 0a. Chat
Still many things in **WIP**.

---
### 0b. Carousel
- [x] still need to fix carousel translation throw X axis. (it works more or less, **but it is not accurate**)
- [x] adjust element to make them have, **almost in every case**, the same *aspect-ratio*.
- [ ] set the `href` of the elements

---
### 1. HomePage
Still everything is "@todo" 
- [x] carousel `<iframe>` is required

---
### 2. Competitions
- [x] carousel `<iframe>` is required
- [ ] div to display games about the competition clicked

---
### 3. Clubs
- [x] **searchbar** adjustments
- [ ] generalize createAccordions()
- [ ] clubs `href` in MainExpressServer, forwarding the user to `"single_page/club/${id}"` 
- [ ] resolve the f. spinner loader

---
### 4. Players
- [x] the ***searchbar*** has to be shown below the **header**, when submit button is triggered
- [x] the ***load more*** function has to be configured to make show players according to the actual number of the players retrieved. ***Half the number is not acceptable for that***.
---
### 5. SinglePage
Still all of its content is a **"@todo"**:
- [ ] single_page/competition
- [ ] single_page/club
- [ ] single_page/game
- [x] single_page/player
